# Forest-Fire-Susceptibility-Mapping-of-the-Western-Ghats-India-Using-Remote-Sensing-GIS-and-ML.
This project maps forest fire susceptibility in the Western Ghats, India using Remote Sensing, GIS, and Random Forest machine learning. Twenty climatic, topographic, vegetation, and anthropogenic factors were integrated with FIRMS fire inventory data to identify fire-prone zones and support forest management and mitigation planning.
Forest Fire Susceptibility Mapping of the Western Ghats, India

🎯 Objectives

Identify forest fire–prone areas in the Western Ghats

Analyze the influence of environmental and human-induced factors

Develop a fire susceptibility map using Random Forest

Validate model performance using historical fire inventory data

Support decision-making for forest fire prevention and management

🌍 Study Area

The Western Ghats is a UNESCO World Heritage Site extending along the western coast of India.
It is characterized by dense forests, complex topography, seasonal droughts, and increasing anthropogenic pressure, making it highly vulnerable to forest fires.

📊 Data and Factors Used

A total of 20 conditioning factors were used and grouped as follows:

🔹 Climatic Factors

Temperature

Rainfall

Wind speed

🔹 Topographic Factors

Elevation

Slope

Aspect

🔹 Vegetation Factors

NDVI

Land Use / Land Cover (LULC)

Forest density

🔹 Anthropogenic Factors

Distance to roads

Distance to settlements

Distance to agricultural land

🔹 Fire Inventory

MODIS FIRMS active fire points (used for model training and validation)

🧠 Methodology

Data preprocessing and normalization in GIS

Extraction of fire and non-fire samples

Training of the Random Forest model

Generation of forest fire susceptibility index

Classification into Very Low, Low, Moderate, High, and Very High risk zones

Accuracy assessment using ROC–AUC and importance analysis

📈 Model Used

Random Forest (RF)

Handles nonlinear relationships

Reduces overfitting

🔍 Key Findings

Areas with dense vegetation and human proximity showed higher fire susceptibility

Climatic and vegetation factors played a dominant role

Random Forest produced reliable and stable results

High and very high risk zones aligned well with historical fire occurrences

🚀 Applications

Forest fire early warning systems

Disaster risk reduction

Forest conservation planning

Environmental management
